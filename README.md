## National Obesity Percentages by State Map Project Overview

This project is a web application that visualizes national obesity percentages by state. It utilizes React.js, vanilla CSS, and Mapbox to display data from the 2015 CDC BRFSS Survey. The primary goal is to provide users with an interactive and informative map-based interface for exploring obesity rates across the United States.

Key Accomplishments
Data Visualization: The project successfully visualizes obesity rates by state, making it easy for users to grasp the disparities and trends in obesity percentages across the country.

React.js Integration: React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, making it a suitable framework for building a dynamic and interactive user interface. It promotes code organization and reusability.

Custom Styling with Vanilla CSS: Vanilla CSS was employed to create a customized and visually appealing interface. This allowed for precise control over the look and feel of the map components and user interface elements.

Mapbox Integration: Mapbox was selected as the mapping platform due to its versatility, robust API, and the ability to handle geospatial data seamlessly. It provides advanced mapping features that enhance user interaction.

Layer Filtering: Two different map layers were implemented to simplify user data retrieval. Filtering by state allows users to focus on specific areas of interest, improving the overall user experience.


Conclusion
This project successfully leverages React.js, vanilla CSS, and Mapbox to create an engaging and informative map-based application for visualizing national obesity percentages by state. The chosen technologies were essential in achieving the project's goals, offering a user-friendly and customizable experience for exploring health data.
